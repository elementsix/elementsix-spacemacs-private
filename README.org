My personal Emacs configuration
Hacking journey begins start from 2017.

It was written for Emacs 25.3+ on MacOS 10.12+

How to use
Follow the install instruction here: https://github.com/zilongshanren/spacemacs#install , make sure your are using the fork repo: https://github.com/zilongshanren/spacemacs

Why use the forked repo? What’s the difference between the forked repo and the original repo?

Nothing difference!

The forked version is only a few commits behind the original repo, becuase sometimes the original repo can’t functional well.

What’s the highlight of this configuration
It’s a highly optimized Spacemacs configuration, you should use the configuration together with the develop branch of the officially Spacemacs.
I prefer to the Ivy completion interface, so I removed many helm related packages but keep the helm-ag package. The counsel-ag counterpart is not powerful as helm-ag.
I also removed some packages I don’t have any chance to use. The complete list lies in the exclude section of the init.el file.
I also exclude the Spaceline package, cause it’s easy to frozen the Emacs with this package enabled. So I create my own mode line configuration based on Spaceline.
The Swiper package sometimes frozen the Emacs UI when you split the window with very long lines. You could use `pkill -SIGUSR2 -i emacs` command line to break the frozen.
